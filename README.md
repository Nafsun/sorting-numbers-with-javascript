# sorting-numbers-with-javascript
 I design a new Javascript sorting algorithm for sorting numbers in order due to the fact that their is no sorting functionin javacript for
 sorting numbers from smallest to the highest
 The way this sorting Algorithm works is that it finds the maximum number in the array first,    then it uses the maximum number to loops through all the values in the array by counting from    1 to maximum number and then checking if that counter is equal to any value in the array.    This means that the first value to be encounter by the counter will be push to the newsort array.
